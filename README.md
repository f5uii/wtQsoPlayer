# wtQsoPlayer

## What is it ?

This free and open source package allows you to publish on the Web your contest audio recordings done with [Win-Test](http://www.win-test.com/) v4.
Once setup, anyone will be able to search in your log and listen to his (her) QSOs, if audio was recorded at that time.
The extracted clips are totally compatible with the mp3 standard, and their ID3 tags are automatically filled. It means you can download, save and replay them locally.

This package is totally open, feel free to submit and share your work with the community !
